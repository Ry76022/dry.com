                <p class="text-small">Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of computer science and engineering.
                    Robotics involves design, construction, operation, and use of robots. The goal of robotics is to
                    design machines that can help and assist humans. Robotics integrates fields of mechanical
                    engineering, electrical engineering, information engineering, mechatronics, electronics,
                    bioengineering, computer engineering, control engineering, software engineering, mathematics, etc.

                Robotics develops machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Robots can be
                used in many situations for many purposes, but today many are used in dangerous environments
                (including inspection of radioactive materials, bomb detection and deactivation), manufacturing
                processes, or where humans cannot survive (e.g. in space, underwater, in high heat, and clean up and
                containment of hazardous materials and radiation). Robots can take on any form, but some are made to
                resemble humans in appearance. This is claimed to help in the acceptance of robots in certain
                replicative behaviors which are usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate
                walking, lifting, speech, cognition, or any other human activity. Many of today's robots are
                inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. read more on </p>

            <p class="text-big">What is a robotics engineer?</p>
            <p class="text-small">Robotics engineering is a field of engineering which centers on building machines that
                replicate human actions. A robotics engineer creates these applications or autonomous machines (aka
                robots) for industries such as mining, manufacturing, automotive, services and more. Often, the goal is
                to program machines to do repetitive, hazardous or unhealthy jobs. read more on </p>

            <p class="text-small">A game programmer is a software engineer who primarily develops video games or related
                software (such as game development tools). The game's codebase development is handled by
                programmers.[103][104] There are usually one to several lead programmers,[105] who implement the game's
                starting codebase and overview future development and programmer allocation on individual modules. An
                entry-level programmer can make, on average, around $70,000 annually and an experienced programmer can
                make, on average, around $125,000 annually.[106]
